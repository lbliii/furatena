## Overview

`chirp` is the command-line entry point installed with the framework. You use it
to scaffold a new project, validate your hypermedia wiring, run the dev or
production server, and inspect routes. This page is the reference for the three
commands you reach for most — `chirp new`, `chirp check`, and
`chirp shapes-codegen` — plus a table of the rest.

Every command takes an app **import string** of the form `module:attribute`
(for example `myapp:app`). When you omit the attribute, it defaults to `app`, so
`myapp` resolves to `myapp.app`. A callable that is not already an `App` — an app
factory like `create_app` — is called to produce one.

```bash
chirp --version        # chirp, kida, pounce, and Python versions
chirp <command> --help # flags for any command
```

## `chirp new` — scaffold a project

`chirp new <name>` creates a project directory you can run immediately. The
default scaffold is auth-ready: a filesystem-routed `pages/` tree with a login
flow, a dashboard, the secure-by-default middleware stack, and a passing
`chirp check`. Flags switch to a different starting point.

```bash
chirp new myapp
cd myapp && python app.py
```

The default scaffold prints its own next steps — a login of `admin` / `password`
and a dashboard at `/dashboard`. It refuses to overwrite an existing directory.

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Flag
  - Result
* - *(none)*
  - Auth + dashboard + filesystem routing (`pages/`), tests, `pyproject.toml`.
* - `--minimal`
  - A single-file project: `app.py` plus `templates/index.html`.
* - `--sse`
  - SSE boilerplate — an `EventStream` route wired with `sse_scope`.
* - `--shell`
  - A persistent [[docs/build-apps/ui-extensions/app-shell|app shell]] (topbar, sidebar) over filesystem routing.
* - `--with-chirpui`
  - Require [[docs/build-apps/ui-extensions/chirp-ui|chirp-ui]] templates; fail if it is not installed.
:::

Every scaffold — including `--minimal` — wires the secure-by-default stack
(`SessionMiddleware` → `CSRFMiddleware` → `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`) and reads
the secret key from `CHIRP_SECRET_KEY`, so a generated app passes `chirp check`
out of the box.

:::{note}
`--with-chirpui` is a hard requirement, not a hint. The other scaffolds detect
chirp-ui automatically: if it is installed they emit chirp-ui templates, and if
it is not they fall back to plain HTML. `--with-chirpui` instead exits with an
error when chirp-ui is missing, so a CI scaffold cannot silently degrade.
:::

## `chirp check` — validate contracts

`chirp check <app>` resolves the app, runs the contract suite, and prints the
report. It is the same validation that [[docs/about/core-concepts/contracts|`app.check()`]]
runs in debug mode — fail loud at startup, not silent at runtime. The process
exits with code 1 when any ERROR-severity issue is found, which makes it a CI
gate.

```bash
chirp check myapp:app
```

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Flag
  - Effect
* - `--warnings-as-errors`
  - Exit 1 if any WARNING is present, not just ERRORs. The standard CI posture.
* - `--coverage`
  - Print route/template contract coverage counters alongside the report.
* - `--deploy`
  - Run env-aware rules with production-posture severity. Implies `--warnings-as-errors`.
:::

`--deploy` is the deploy preflight. Some rules — a missing secure-by-default
stack on an app with mutating routes is the canonical one — fire at a lower
severity in development than in production. `--deploy` escalates those to
production posture even when you run it locally, so a deploy-blocking
misconfiguration surfaces as an ERROR before you ship. It does not mutate your
app; a genuinely deploy-ready app still passes.

```bash
# Standard CI gate — fail on any error or warning
chirp check myapp:app --warnings-as-errors

# Deploy preflight — production posture (implies --warnings-as-errors)
chirp check myapp:app --deploy
```

The model behind this command — categories versus severities, environment-aware
severity, and custom checks — lives in
[[docs/about/core-concepts/contracts|Contracts]]. The full per-category severity
table is the [[docs/quality/contracts-debugging/categories|Contract Category Reference]].

## `chirp shapes-codegen` — adopt and audit Shapes

:::{since} 0.8
:::

`chirp shapes-codegen [path]` helps you adopt [[docs/build-apps/forms-data/shapes|Shapes]]
incrementally. It has two non-destructive modes.

**Suggest decorators (default).** It scans Python files for frozen dataclasses
sitting near an explicit named-column `SELECT` literal, pairs each class to the
`SELECT` whose output columns are a subset of its fields, and prints a
`@shape(...)` suggestion above each match. `--dry-run` is the default and the
only write behavior — nothing on disk changes.

```bash
chirp shapes-codegen pages/
```

```text
--- pages/boards.py:14 (BoardView)
+ @shape('SELECT id, title FROM boards WHERE id = :id')
  @dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
  class BoardView:  # columns: id, title
3 @shape suggestion(s) (dry-run — no files written).
```

Already-decorated classes are skipped, and only `SELECT`s the conservative parser
can read are paired (`SELECT *`, expressions, CTEs, and `UNION` are skipped), so a
suggestion is always one the contract checker can later verify.

**Audit drift (`--audit`).** It loads an app and reports every surface-contract
name with no backing Shape, reusing the exact registry-drift logic `app.check()`
runs. With `--audit`, `path` becomes an app import string, and the command exits
non-zero when drift is found — so it drops straight into CI.

```bash
chirp shapes-codegen myapp:app --audit
```

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Argument / flag
  - Purpose
* - `path`
  - Directory or file to scan (default `.`); with `--audit`, an app import string like `myapp:app`.
* - `--dry-run`
  - Print suggested `@shape` decorators without writing files (the default behavior).
* - `--audit`
  - Audit `surface_contracts` for names with no backing Shape; exit non-zero on drift.
* - `--migrations DIR`
  - Migrations directory (reserved for future incremental codegen output).
:::

## `chirp migrate` — apply pending migrations

:::{since} 0.9
:::

`chirp migrate --db <url> --migrations-dir <dir>` applies pending migrations
from a directory as a **one-shot job**. It connects to the database, runs
[[docs/build-apps/forms-data/database|`migrate()`]], prints a summary, and
disconnects. It does **not** import or boot your app (no freeze, no contract
checks) — it takes the same `--db` / `--migrations-dir` flags as
`makemigrations`, not an app import string.

```bash
chirp migrate --db "$DATABASE_URL" --migrations-dir migrations
```

It is fail-loud: a failed migration, an invalid migrations directory, or a
checksum-drift edit of an already-applied migration prints the error and exits
`1`. Nothing is swallowed.

Pair it with `AppConfig(skip_migrations=True)` (or `CHIRP_SKIP_MIGRATIONS=1`) so
the app does not also run migrations on boot. In a multi-replica deploy this
lets a single pre-deploy job own migration application instead of every replica
racing on startup. When the on-boot run is skipped, the app logs a
`lifecycle:migrations-skipped` warning so a missing deploy job (and the
resulting stale schema) is visible. See
[[docs/quality/deployment/production|Production deployment]].

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Flag
  - Effect
* - `--db`
  - Database URL (required), e.g. `sqlite:///app.db`.
* - `--migrations-dir`
  - Directory containing migration files (default `migrations`).

## Gotchas

:::{warning}
`chirp check` and the other app-loading commands **import your app module** to
resolve the import string. Side effects at import time — opening a database,
binding a port — run during the check. Keep module-level code import-safe, and
put startup work behind `app.run()` or a factory function.
