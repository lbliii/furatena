Test your Chirp app the way it actually runs — drive real requests through the
ASGI handler, then assert on the fragment, OOB, and SSE responses that come
back. Start with the [[docs/quality/testing/test-client|TestClient]] to make
requests without a running server, then reach for the
[[docs/quality/testing/assertions|fragment and SSE assertions]] to check the
hypermedia your handlers return.
