New to Chirp? This section is the *why* and the *how it works*. Skim it to decide
whether Chirp fits your project, then jump to [[docs/get-started/_index|Get Started]]
when you're ready to build. Evaluators want **Philosophy**, **When to Use Chirp**, and
**Non-Goals**; deep-divers want **Architecture** and **Thread Safety**.
