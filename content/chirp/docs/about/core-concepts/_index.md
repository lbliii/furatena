Chirp's mental model comes in three pieces: handlers return values that carry
rendering intent — [[docs/about/core-concepts/return-values|the return type *is*
the intent]] — the app freezes from a mutable setup phase into an immutable
runtime, and configuration is one explicit frozen object. Start here when a
task-oriented guide assumes that model and you want the why behind it.
