## What "hypermedia model" means

Chirp sends **HTML over the wire** — full pages, page fragments, and streamed
HTML — instead of JSON that a client framework turns into HTML. The server owns
rendering. The browser (often with [htmx](https://htmx.org)) swaps the HTML it
receives into the page. There is no client-side state store, no serialization
layer, and no separate API to keep in sync with the UI.

That leaves one question for every route: *which slice of HTML should this
request get?* Chirp answers it from the value your handler returns. **The return
type is the intent.**

```python
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return "Hello, World!"          # -> 200 text/html

@app.route("/api/status")
def status():
    return {"status": "ok"}         # -> 200 application/json
```

You never call `make_response()` or `jsonify()`. You return a value; Chirp turns
it into the right response. If you have ever returned `render_template(...)` in
Flask and reached for `jsonify(...)` on the next line, this is the same idea with
the wiring removed.

## Three things a request can ask for

A hypermedia app serves the *same* template at different scopes depending on who
is asking. Chirp recognises three render intents.

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - Intent
  - The request looks like
  - Chirp sends
* - **Full page**
  - A browser navigation — no htmx
  - The whole template, layout and all
* - **Page fragment**
  - An htmx navigation (`hx-boost`, history restore)
  - A self-contained page region, no outer chrome
* - **Local fragment**
  - A narrow htmx swap (`hx-get` into a target)
  - A single named [[docs/build-apps/html-fragments/fragment-blocks|template block]]
:::

A template block is a named region of a template
(`{% block results %}…{% endblock %}`). The novelty
of the hypermedia model is that one template, with named blocks, serves *all
three* intents — there is no separate "partials" directory and no API view to
maintain alongside the page.

## Content negotiation: how Chirp decides

Chirp picks the intent from the request, so most handlers never branch on it
themselves. Two signals drive the decision:

1. **The return type** you chose — `Template`, `Fragment`, `Page`, and the rest.
2. **The `HX-Request` header** htmx sends on every request it issues.

The clearest expression of this is the `Page` return type. You hand it one
template and one block name; it renders the full page for a browser and just the
block for htmx — no `if` statement in your handler.

```python
from chirp import App, Page, Request

app = App()

@app.route("/search")
def search(request: Request):
    books = run_search(request.query.get("q", ""))
    return Page("search.html", "results", books=books)
```

A browser hitting `/search` gets `search.html` rendered in full. An htmx request
swapping `#results` gets only the `results` block — same handler, same template,
same data. Chirp adds a `Vary: HX-Request` response header so a cache never serves
a fragment to a browser or a full page to htmx.

:::{tip}
`Page` is the negotiating type; `Template` is the always-full-page type. If you
write `Page("page.html", **ctx)` with no block name, you almost certainly want
`Template("page.html", **ctx)`. Chirp raises a guided `TypeError` to point you at
the right one.
:::

## The return-type vocabulary

Every render intent and transport has a return type. You pick the type that names
your intent; Chirp handles status codes, headers, and content negotiation.

:::{list-table}
:header-rows: 1

* - You want
  - You return
* - A full page rendered from a template
  - `Template("page.html", **ctx)`
* - One named block, no full page
  - `Fragment("page.html", "block", **ctx)`
* - Full page for browsers, fragment for htmx
  - `Page("page.html", "block", **ctx)`
* - Several swap targets in one response
  - `OOB(main, *oob_fragments)`
* - A shell now, slow sections streamed in
  - `Suspense("page.html", stats=load())`
* - A live channel after the page loads
  - `EventStream(generator())`
* - Plain HTML or JSON
  - a `str` or a `dict`

This is the heart of the framework, and it has its own page. The full catalog —
every type, its signature, and a decision tree for choosing between them — lives
in [[docs/about/core-concepts/return-values|Return Values]].

## Why HTML over the wire

The mental model pays off because the parts that usually drift cannot drift here.

- **One source of truth for the UI.** The HTML a browser sees and the HTML an
  htmx swap receives come from the same template and the same handler. There is
  no second JSON representation to keep aligned with the markup.
- **State lives on the server.** The page reflects server state directly, so you
  do not reconcile a client store against the database on every interaction.
- **Progressive enhancement is the default.** A route that returns a `Page` works
  as a plain HTML form without JavaScript; htmx upgrades it to a partial swap
  when present.

### No client-config blob to keep in sync

The clearest cost of the JSON/SPA model is the hand-maintained client-config
contract. A SPA cannot render until it knows what the server enabled, so the
server hand-builds a config blob the client fetches on boot — and then re-states
every one of those flags again on the admin side so they can be read and written
over the wire.

[open-webui](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) is a representative
example. Its `GET /api/config` handler returns a role-gated dictionary of server
flags the SPA fetches before it can render
(`backend/open_webui/main.py:2367`, returning a ~140-line dict through
`main.py:2539`). Editing those same flags needs a second surface:
`backend/open_webui/routers/configs.py` declares Pydantic `*ConfigForm` models
and paired `GET`/`POST` admin handlers — ~20 route handlers restating the same
field names (`configs.py:71` onward). A single flag like `enable_channels` is
typed in the Pydantic model, read in the GET handler, written in the POST
handler, and emitted in the boot blob — four hand-aligned restatements that must
not drift.

In Chirp the server-known flag is a value in the render context, consumed
directly in the template at render time. There is no boot blob and no
client-config contract — the flag and the markup that depends on it live in the
same place:

```python
import os

from chirp import App

app = App()

# Your own server-side flag — env var, settings object, feature service, etc.
FEATURE_CHANNELS = os.environ.get("FEATURE_CHANNELS") == "1"

# Make it available to every template (or pass it per-route as render context,
# or via a pages `_context.py` provider).
@app.template_global("enable_channels")
def enable_channels() -> bool:
    return FEATURE_CHANNELS
```

```html
{% if enable_channels %}
  <a href="/channels" class="nav-link">Channels</a>
{% endif %}
```

The flag is read where it is used. There is no `/api/config` endpoint to write,
no Pydantic form to keep aligned with it, and no client store to reconcile — the
contract the SPA had to maintain by hand simply does not exist. This is the
concrete shape of "no serialization layer." For the trade-offs of the JSON bet
as a whole, see [[docs/about/comparison|Comparison]].

[[docs/about/philosophy|Philosophy]]; for the trade-offs versus a JSON/SPA stack,

## Gotchas

:::{warning}
`request.is_fragment` is deprecated and ambiguous for boosted navigations. When
you genuinely need to branch by hand, use `request.is_htmx` (any htmx request) or
`request.is_narrow_fragment` (a narrow swap, excluding `hx-boost` and history
restore). Better: return a `Page` and let content negotiation make the decision
for you.
:::

## Going deeper

::::{dropdown} How Chirp computes the render intent
For `Page`, `LayoutPage`, and `PageComposition` returns, Chirp builds a
`RenderPlan` before any HTML is produced. The plan resolves to one of three
intents — `"full_page"`, `"page_fragment"`, or `"local_fragment"` — based on the
`HX-Request` header, whether the request is a boosted navigation or a history
restore, and the `HX-Target` of the swap.

Middleware can read the plan with `get_render_plan(request)` to log or act on the
rendering decision. The full mechanism, including layout-chain matching, is
covered in [[docs/build-apps/request-pipeline/render-plan|RenderPlan Middleware]].
