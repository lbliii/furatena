Stream HTML to the browser as it becomes ready, or push updates after the page
has loaded. This section covers the three return types that move content over
time: `Stream` and `Suspense` for the initial render, and `EventStream`
(Server-Sent Events) for post-load updates. Signals and the reactive system
build on `EventStream` to fan one server value out to many bound elements
automatically.

:::{note} Which one do I reach for?
A slow first paint that should appear section-by-section is `Stream`. A
dashboard whose shell should appear instantly while slow panels fill in is
`Suspense`. A feed that updates after the page is live is `EventStream`.
Cross-page chrome and post-mutation fan-out belong on
[[docs/build-apps/streaming-updates/realtime-decision-tree|the realtime decision tree]]
(includes Stream / Suspense / EventStream / Signal / OOB and a Lucky Cat map).
