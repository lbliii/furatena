Every handler receives a `Request` and returns a value that Chirp turns into a
response. `Request` is a frozen, read-only snapshot of the incoming HTTP request
-- method, path, headers, cookies, query string, and an async-readable body.
When you need to control the raw response (status, headers, cookies, redirects),
you build a `Response` through chainable `.with_*()` transformations; each call
returns a new immutable copy.

Most handlers never construct a `Response` directly. They return a
[[docs/about/core-concepts/return-values|return type]] like `Template` or
`Fragment` and let Chirp negotiate the response. Reach for `Request` and
`Response` when you need the raw HTTP details.

## Request

`Request` is a frozen dataclass -- a snapshot of what arrived. The data does not
change under you mid-handler, and the object is honest about that.

```python
@app.route("/search")
async def search(request: Request):
    q = request.query.get("q", "")
    lang = request.headers.get("Accept-Language", "en")
    session = request.cookies.get("session_id")
    return Template("search.html", q=q)
```

### Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `method` | `str` | HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) |
| `path` | `str` | Request path (`/search`) |
| `query` | `QueryParams` | Query string parameters |
| `headers` | `Headers` | Immutable request headers |
| `cookies` | `dict[str, str]` | Parsed cookies |
| `content_type` | `str \| None` | Content-Type header value |

### Async body access

The body is read asynchronously -- it may not have arrived yet. Pick the access
method that matches your content type; they all read the same underlying body.

::::{code-tabs}
:sync: body

```python title="Raw bytes"
async def upload(request: Request):
    body_bytes = await request.body()
```

```python title="Decoded text"
async def note(request: Request):
    text = await request.text()
```

```python title="Parsed JSON"
async def api(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
```

```python title="Form data"
async def submit(request: Request):
    form = await request.form()
```

```python title="Stream chunks"
async def ingest(request: Request):
    async for chunk in request.stream():
        process(chunk)
```

### htmx detection

When a request comes from htmx, you can branch on it. The richest surface is the
typed `request.htmx` namespace ([`HtmxDetails`](https://github.com/lbliii/chirp/blob/main/src/chirp/http/request.py)),
which is truthy when the `HX-Request` header is present:

```python
@app.route("/results")
def results(request: Request):
    if request.htmx:                 # any htmx request
        target = request.htmx.target  # HX-Target value (e.g. "#results")
        trigger = request.htmx.trigger
    ...
```

For most handlers you do not need to branch by hand at all -- return a
[[docs/build-apps/html-fragments/fragments|Page]] and Chirp negotiates a fragment
for htmx and a full page for browsers. Branch manually only when the two paths
truly differ.

Two convenience properties cover the common questions:

| Property | True when |
|----------|-----------|
| `request.is_htmx` | Any htmx request (`HX-Request` present) |
| `request.is_narrow_fragment` | A narrow swap -- excludes boosted navigations and history restores, which still need full page content |

:::{deprecated} request.is_fragment
`request.is_fragment` is ambiguous for boosted navigations and emits a
`DeprecationWarning`. Use `request.is_htmx` (any htmx request) or
`request.is_narrow_fragment` (narrow swap only).
:::

:::{tip}
The flat `request.htmx_target` / `request.htmx_trigger` properties are
convenience shims that delegate to `request.htmx`. Prefer the typed namespace --
`request.htmx.target`, `request.htmx.boosted`, `request.htmx.history_restore`,
`request.htmx.target_id` (the bare DOM id used throughout the framework's
request pipeline).
:::

### QueryParams and Headers

Both `QueryParams` and `Headers` implement the `MultiValueMapping` protocol --
the same key can carry multiple values:

```python
# First value
q = request.query.get("q", "")

# All values for a key
tags = request.query.get_list("tag")   # ["python", "web"]

# Typed coercion (None if missing or unparseable)
page = request.query.get_int("page", 1)
debug = request.query.get_bool("debug", False)

# Existence
if "q" in request.query:
    ...
```

## Response

Responses are built through chainable transformations. Each `.with_*()` returns
a new `Response`:

```python
return (
    Response("Created")
    .with_status(201)
    .with_header("Location", "/users/42")
    .with_cookie("session", token)
)
```

### Chainable methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.with_status(code)` | Set status code |
| `.with_header(name, value)` | Add a header |
| `.with_headers(dict)` | Add multiple headers |
| `.with_content_type(type)` | Set Content-Type |
| `.with_cookie(name, value, **opts)` | Set a cookie |
| `.without_cookie(name)` | Delete a cookie |

`.with_header()` and `.with_headers()` *append* -- they do not replace an
existing header of the same name.

:::{dropdown} Why responses are immutable
Each `.with_*()` call creates a new `Response`; the original is never mutated:

```python
base = Response("OK")
with_header = base.with_header("X-Custom", "value")

# base is unchanged
# with_header is a new Response with the added header
```

Immutability makes responses safe to pass through
[[docs/build-apps/request-pipeline/_index|response-transforming middleware]]
without one layer accidentally clobbering another's headers.
:::

### htmx response headers

Chirp provides htmx-specific response methods:

```python
return (
    Response("OK")
    .with_hx_location("/new-page")                  # HX-Location
    .with_hx_trigger("item-added")                  # HX-Trigger
    .with_hx_trigger_after_settle("refresh-count")  # HX-Trigger-After-Settle
)
```

## Redirects

`Redirect` is the plain HTTP redirect, defaulting to status `302`:

```python
from chirp import Redirect

@app.route("/old")
def old():
    return Redirect("/new")
```

For a redirect that must work for both htmx and plain requests, use
`hx_redirect()` (status `303` by default):

```python
from chirp import hx_redirect

@app.route("/items/{id:int}/archive", methods=["POST"])
def archive_item(id: int):
    archive(id)
    return hx_redirect("/items")
```

:::{danger} Never set Location and HX-Redirect by hand together
An htmx request runs over XHR, which follows a `Location` header *before* it ever
reads `HX-Redirect` -- so a response carrying both silently does the wrong thing.
`hx_redirect()` exists to solve exactly this: the negotiation layer strips the
conflicting header per client. htmx requests receive `200` with `HX-Redirect`
only (no `Location`); non-htmx requests receive the HTTP redirect via `Location`
only. Compose the two headers manually and you reintroduce the footgun.
:::

:::{tip}
For form POST success paths, prefer `FormAction` or `MutationResult` over
`hx_redirect()` -- they apply the same negotiation automatically. See
[[docs/build-apps/forms-data/forms-validation|form POST success paths]].
